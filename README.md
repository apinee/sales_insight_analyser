# Problem Statement

ABC Hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to various clients. They have their head office in Delhi, India, and many regional offices throughout the country. Apoorva Jha, the sales director, struggles to obtain accurate sales insights due to regional managers' biased reporting and excessive data. He seeks a simplified, visual representation of the data for better decision-making.

The reliance on verbal reports from regional managers leads to a distorted view of the sales performance. This affects Apoorvaâ€™s ability to make informed decisions based on accurate data. The overwhelming amount of Excel files complicates the analysis process. Apoorva desires a more straightforward way to understand key sales metrics without sifting through numerous spreadsheets.

Implementing a dashboard solution like Power BI allows Apoorva to visualize data effectively. This enables him to track sales trends and make data-driven decisions to enhance company performance.

## Project Planning

The second part of this project includes project planning. Project planning for data analytics at AtliQ Hardware involves using the AIMS grid to clarify purpose, stakeholders, end results, and success criteria effectively. This structured approach facilitates better project outcomes and resource management.

### AIMS Grid Components

1. **Identifying Pain Points**
   - The first component emphasizes identifying the key pain points in the project, ensuring focused efforts on addressing specific challenges. This clarity helps streamline the project direction.

2. **Stakeholder Involvement**
   - Stakeholder involvement is crucial, including teams from marketing, sales, IT, and data analytics. This ensures comprehensive insights and collaboration throughout the project's lifecycle. This inclusive approach enhances project effectiveness.

3. **Defining Success Criteria**
   - Defining success criteria is essential to measure project success accurately, such as reducing costs by 10% and improving information delivery methods. This quantifiable goal supports accountability and progress tracking.

The AIMS grid is a powerful project management tool that helps define success criteria and monitor project progress efficiently, significantly enhancing project outcomes.
